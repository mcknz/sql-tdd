SETUP
1. Download tSQLt from http://tsqlt.org/downloads/.

2. Unzip the file to a location on your hard drive (e.g., C:\tSQLt_Install)

3. Make sure CLRs are enabled on the development server, by running the following script in C:\tSQLt_Install\SetClrEnabled.sql:
	EXEC sp_configure 'clr enabled', 1;
	RECONFIGURE;
	GO
	
4. Set the development database to trustworthy for tSQLt to run, by uncommenting and running the following script in C:\tSQLt_Install\SetClrEnabled.sql:
	DECLARE @cmd NVARCHAR(MAX);
	SET @cmd='ALTER DATABASE ' + QUOTENAME(DB_NAME()) + ' SET TRUSTWORTHY ON;';
	EXEC(@cmd);

5. Execute the C:\tSQLt_Install\tSQLt.class.sql script in the development database.

SOURCE CONTROL
tSQLt tests should be checked into source control, but the tSQLt framework itself should not.

UNINSTALL
Running the tSQLt.Uninstall procedure removes tSQLt from the database.
