# SQL TDD

This repo contains the SQL scripts necessary to duplicate the test-driven development examples shown in the presentation *Hey, You Got Your TDD In My SQL DB*. Your goal is to create, using TDD, a stored procedure called MergeCustomer, that takes two duplicate customers, each with an order history, and merges them into a single customer record that contains all orders.

To create your own tests and code, see the [starting scripts directory](./starting-scripts/).

The [completed scripts and tests](./completed-scripts/) are also available for review.
